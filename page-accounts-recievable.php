                    Prime Doc Billing helps you get paid faster to increase your business’s financial health. Our AR Management Service consists of several steps to complete the process on time. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:
                </p>
                
                <div class="space-y-6">

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            The Accounts Receivable process begins with creating claims for insurance companies. Our team first sends the claim to the clearinghouse. If the claim passes validation, it is submitted to the payer. However, if the clearinghouse rejects the claim, our experts review the errors, make the necessary corrections, and resubmit it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            If the insurance company denies the claim, our experts analyze the entire process from the beginning. We then determine whether the denial was made in error or if an appeal needs to be submitted.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 hover:shadow-md transition duration-300">

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            When it comes to receiving overdue payments, two key payers come to mind. The first one is the insurance companies, and the other is the patients themselves. Our company has different strategies for both of them:
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            <strong>Insurance Companies:</strong> Our experts perform consistent follow-up on overdue claims from the insurance companies. We also track claim status to find out whether the claim is under review or denied. Reviewing the status can also identify any missing documentation. We resubmit those documents to handle AR timely.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            <strong>Patients:</strong> We follow up on the due payments from patients by a step-by-step process:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4">
                            <li>We send out monthly patient statements for three months</li>
                            <li>Our Virtual Assistant then calls them to help make payment through a secure mode</li>
                            <li>If the patient is still unable to pay, they are then sent to the collection agency with the consent of doctor</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mb-3">Denial Identification, and Recovery</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Denial identification refers to the process of figuring out the reasons for denial. It can be:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 ml-4">
                            <li>Missing documentation</li>
                            <li>Incorrect information</li>
                            <li>Lack of prior authorization</li>
                            <li>Incorrect coding</li>
                            <li>Lack of prior authorization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            Once we find out the reason for the denial, it gets easier to correct and resubmit the claims. Our team keeps track of resubmissions to ensure the payment is processed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                            Our experts recover revenue to maximize reimbursements. A detailed root-cause analysis can prevent claims from denial in the future.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            If our team does not agree with the denial, we file for an appeal. Sometimes, the insurance accepts the appeal, but other times, it will go unanswered. In that case, we would file an appeal for the second time.
                        </p>
